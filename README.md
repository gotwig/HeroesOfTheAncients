# Heroes of the Ancients

Heroes of the Ancients is an upcoming DotA2 mod, trying to bring the best ideas from Heroes of the Storm TM from Blizzard Entertainment TM to Valves DotA2.

Featuring
  - Heavy Teamcombat (All teamplayers share the same level)
  - Dynamic Events
  - No items, no gold
  - Opening/Closing the mines
  - wizard health drops
  - moon wells to restore hp/mp of your hero

The goal of those ideas, is heavy team combat, with, in ideal case, no long routes to go, and a lot of action for the players.

All these core features, except dynamic events, are already implemented in the mod, and work in their basic form.

### Installation
Drag the two directories into your dota2 main directory, and merge the folder contents of the folders "game" and "content". 

For example on Windows:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta
```

I'm called "berz3rk" on IRC.
Up to this point everything in this project is developed by me (gotwig)

I am currently searching people in the following positions:
* Heroes/Abilities - Adjust the Abilities and Heroes to their HotS counterparts
* 3D Modelers - Maybe some custom 3D models for Heroes? (I know thats much work)
* Map Designer - Design with Hammer new HotA maps, which make use of our new custom entities, and dynamic events

### Todos

 - New UI
 - Respawning neutral camps and the right timing, adjusted to the HotS counterpart.
 - Hideable Grass (in the works, there are good results)
 - Finishing the map "Haunted Mines"

Thanks for your interest in this mod.

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
