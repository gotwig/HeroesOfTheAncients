Featuring
  - "Haunted Mines" - a complete playable map.
  - Heavy Teamcombat (All teamplayers share the same level)
  - Dynamic Events
  - No items, no gold
  - Opening/Closing the mines
  - Wizard health drops
  - Moon wells to restore hp/mp of your hero
  - Bandit Squads, groups of monsters which are for the fight winner to capture
  - Lookouts, which grant large map vision once captured
  - "Fast Travel" ability for faster movement
  - "Teleport Scroll" ability to homebase across the map
  - Hide in high grass from your enemies to plan deadly attacks or heal yourself up
  - Towers have ammo limitations
  - Gates protect you from taking damage

The goal of those ideas, is heavy team combat, with, in ideal case, no long routes to go, and a lot of action for the players.

All these core features, except dynamic events, are already implemented in the mod, and work in their basic form.
