Heroes of the Ancients is an upcoming DotA2 mod, trying to bring the best ideas from Heroes of the Storm TM from Blizzard Entertainment TM to Valves DotA2.

Featuring
  - "Haunted Mines" - a complete playable map.
  - Heavy Teamcombat (All teamplayers share the same level)
  - Dynamic Events
  - No items, no gold
  - Opening/Closing the mines
  - Wizard health drops
  - Moon wells to restore hp/mp of your hero
  - Mercenary Camps, groups of monsters which are for the fight winner to capture
  - Watch Towers, which grant large map vision once captured
  - "Mount" ability for faster movement
  - "Teleport" ability to homebase across the map
  - Hide in high grass from your enemies to plan deadly attacks or heal yourself up
  - Towers have ammo limitations
  - Gates protect you from taking damage

The goal of those ideas, is heavy team combat, with, in ideal case, no long routes to go, and a lot of action for the players.

All these core features, except dynamic events, are already implemented in the mod, and work in their basic form.

### Installation
Drag the two directories into your dota2 main directory, and merge the folder contents of the folders "game" and "content". 

For example on Windows:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta
```

I'm called "berz3rk" on IRC.
Up to this point everything in this project is developed by me (gotwig)

I am currently searching people in the following positions:
* Heroes/Abilities - Adjust the Abilities and Heroes to their HotS counterparts
* 3D Modelers - Maybe some custom 3D models for Heroes? (I know thats much work)
* Map Designer - Design with Hammer new HotA maps, which make use of our new custom entities, and dynamic events

### Todos
 - Release on Steam Workshop
 - Some other things
 - Gameplay Tests

Thanks for your interest in this mod.

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
